# Google My Business API Setup Guide

## Current Status
âœ… **Ready to use** - The component is working with mock data and ready for Google API integration when you get credentials.

## When you get Google My Business API credentials:

### 1. Add Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:
```
GOOGLE_MY_BUSINESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GOOGLE_MY_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
```

### 2. Enable the API in Your Component
In `/app/page.tsx`, update the GoogleReviews component:
```tsx
<GoogleReviews 
  placeId="your-google-business-place-id" 
  useMyBusinessAPI={true}
  maxReviews={6}
  className="bg-[#fffaf6]" 
/>
```

### 3. Uncomment API Code
In `/app/api/google-my-business-reviews/route.ts`, uncomment the API integration code (lines 49-95).

### 4. Benefits Over Current Setup
- **All reviews**: Not limited to just 5 reviews like Places API
- **More data**: Richer review information
- **Business owner control**: Full access to your business reviews
- **Better reliability**: Direct access to your business data

## How it Works Now
- **Current**: Uses authentic mock data from your real Google reviews
- **After setup**: Will fetch live reviews from Google My Business API
- **Fallback**: Always falls back to mock data if API fails

## Testing
The component is already integrated and working. You can:
- View reviews on desktop and mobile
- See the Google branding and rating display  
- Browse through reviews with navigation

When you're ready to connect to the real API, just follow the steps above!
